### Why is not PSP emulation enabled if emulatorjs supports it?

PSP emulation with the PPSSPP core requires special setup with a reverse proxy, or launching Chrome browser with the ``--disable-web-security`` and ``--enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer`` flags, which **WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE** as it disables important security features.

### When will the next version of RomM come out?

### When will X feature be available?

Sometime between now and the heat death of the universe.

Same as above question.
